# PlanetarySystem

This Julia package was produced for an assignment of the Computational Physics course, held by Erik Schnetter at Perimeter Institute, during the Fall term 2018.
The package solves the N-body problem in Newtonian gravity. The package is based on the [tutorial ](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqTutorials.jl/blob/master/PhysicalModels/Outer-Solar-System.ipynb)
The author thanks Job Feldbrugge and Stephen Green for their comments and suggestions.
